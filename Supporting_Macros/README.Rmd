#### Usage

__R Code__

1. Edit `Logistic_Regression1.R` to update the logic of the tool. 
2. Use the [style guide](Style_Guide.md) while writing your R code. 
3. Use the `Data` folder to store any data used. 
4. Run `insertRcode("Logistic_Regression.yxmc", "Logistic_Regression1.R")` to insert R code back into the macro. Note that you will have to close and reopen the macro for the changes in the R tool to take effect.

#### Configuration Parameters

This configuration is autogenerated from `Logistic_Regression.yxmc`.


```{r echo = F}
library(AlteryxRhelper)
